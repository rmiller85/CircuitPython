# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments

led_fade.py: Made an LED fade using a for loop and duty cycle

circuitPython_servo.py: Made a servo go back and forth by touching a wire. 
Used built-in touch sensing on the Metro Express and touchio module. Used
pwm for servo movement.

circuitPython_lcd.py: Made an LCD screen display # of times a button had 
been pressed

photo_interrupt.py: Made a counter of how many times a photo interrupter had
been interrupted. Made a 4-second timer so that it is constantly looping, but
only prints the number of interrupts once every 4 seconds.
